Fig. 2. CSF Functions
The Functions should be addressed concurrently. Actions that support GOVERN, IDENTIFY, PROTECT,
and DETECT should all happen continuously, and actions that support RESPOND and RECOVER
should be ready at all times and happen when cybersecurity incidents occur. All Functions have
vital roles related to cybersecurity incidents GOVERN, IDENTIFY, and PROTECT outcomes help
prevent and prepare for incidents, while GOVERN, DETECT, RESPOND, and RECOVER outcomes help
discover and manage incidents
Each Function is named after a verb that summarizes its contents Each Function is divided into
Categories, which are related cybersecurity outcomes that collectively comprise the Function
Subcategories further divide each Category into more specific outcomes of technical and
management activities. The Subcategories are not exhaustive, but they describe detailed
outcomes that support each Category.
The Functions, Categories, and Subcategories apply to all ICT used by an organization, including
information technology (IT), the Internet of Things (loT), and operational technology (OT). They
also apply to all types of technology environments, including cloud, mobile, and artificial
intelligence systems. The CSF Core is forward-looking and intended to apply to future changes
in technologies and environments.

AC.L1-3.1.1 - Authorized Access Control
Access Control (AC)
AC.L1-3.1.1 - AUTHORIZED ACCESS CONTROL
Limit information system access to authorized users, processes acting on behalf of
authorized users, or devices (including other information systems).
ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES [NIST SP 800-171A]
Determine if:
[a] authorized users are identified;
[b] processes acting on behalf of authorized users are identified;
[c] devices (and other systems) authorized to connect to the system are identified;
[d] system access is limited to authorized users;
[e] system access is limited to processes acting on behalf of authorized users; and
[f] system access is limited to authorized devices (including other systems).
POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS [NIST SP 800-171A]
Examine
[SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing account management; system
security plan; system design documentation; system configuration settings and associated
documentation; list of active system accounts and the name of the individual associated with
each account; notifications or records of recently transferred, separated, or terminated
employees; list of conditions for group and role membership; list of recently disabled system
accounts along with the name of the individual associated with each account; access
authorization records; account management compliance reviews; system monitoring

AC.L1-3.1.1 Authorized Access Control
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2]
Access control policies (e.g., identity- or role-based policies, control matrices, and
cryptography) control access between active entities or subjects (i.e., users or processes
acting on behalf of users) and passive entities or objects (e.g., devices, files, records, and
domains) in systems. Access enforcement mechanisms can be employed at the application
and service level to provide increased information security. Other systems include systems
internal and external to the organization. This requirement focuses on account management
for systems and applications. The definition of and enforcement of access authorizations,
other than those determined by account type (e.g., privileged verses [sic] non-privileged) are
addressed in requirement 3.1.2 (AC.L1-3.1.2).
FURTHER DISCUSSION
Identify users, processes, and devices that are allowed to use company computers and can
log on to the company network. Automated updates and other automatic processes should
be associated with the user who initiated (authorized) the process. Limit the devices (e.g.,
printers) that can be accessed by company computers. Set up your system so that only
authorized users, processes, and devices can access the company network.
This practice, AC.L1-3.1.1, controls system access based on user, process, or device
identity. AC.L1-3.1.1 leverages IA.L.1-3.5.1 which provides a vetted and trusted identity for
access control.
Example 1
Your company maintains a list of all personnel authorized to use company information
systems [a]. This list is used to support identification and authentication activities conducted
by IT when authorizing access to systems [a,d].
Example 2
A coworker wants to buy a new multi-function printer/scanner/fax device and make it
available on the company network You explain that the company controls system and device
access to the network, and will prevent network access by unauthorized systems and devices
[c]. You help the coworker submit a ticket that asks for the printer to be granted access to
the network, and appropriate leadership approves the device [f].
Potential Assessment Considerations
Is a list of authorized users maintained that defines their identities and roles [a]?
Are account requests authorized before system access is granted [d,e,f]?4

AC.L1-3.1.2 - Transaction & Function Control
AC.L1-3.1.2 - TRANSACTION & FUNCTION CONTROL
Limit information system access to the types of transactions and functions that authorized
users are permitted to execute.
ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES [NIST SP 800-171A]
Determine if:
[a] the types of transactions and functions that authorized users are permitted to execute
are defined; and
[b] system access is limited to the defined types of transactions and functions for
authorized users.
POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS [NIST SP 800-171A]
Examine

[SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing access control policy].
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2]
Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account, by type
of account, or a combination of both. System account types include individual, shared, group,
system, anonymous, guest, emergency, developer, manufacturer, vendor, and temporary.
Other attributes required for authorizing access include restrictions on time-of-day, day-of-
week, and point-of -origin. In defining other account attributes, organizations consider
system-related requirements (e.g., system upgrades scheduled maintenance,) and mission
or business requirements, (e.g., time zone differences, customer requirements, remote
access to support travel requirements).
CMMC Self-Assessment Guide - Level 1 Version 2.0
12
AC.L1-3.1.2 - Transaction & Function Control
FURTHER DISCUSSION
Limit users to only the information systems, roles, or applications they are permitted to use
and are needed for their roles and responsibilities. Limit access to applications and data
based on the authorized users' roles and responsibilities. Common types of functions a user
can be assigned are create, read, update, and delete.
Example
You supervise the team that manages DoD contracts for your company. Members of your
team need to access the contract information to perform their work properly. Because some
of that data contains FCI, you work with IT to set up your group's systems so that users can
be assigned access based on their specific roles [a]. Each role limits whether an employee
has read-access or create/read/delete/update -access [b]. Implementing this access control
restricts access to FCI information unless specifically authorized.
Potential Assessment Considerations
Are access control lists used to limit access to applications and data based on role and/or
identity [a]?s
Is access for authorized users restricted to those parts of the system they are explicitly
permitted to use (e.g., a person who only performs word-processing cannot access
developer tools) [b]?6

AC.L1-3.1.20 - External Connections
AC.L1-3.1.20 EXTERNAL CONNECTIONS
Verify and control/limit connections to and use of external information systems.
ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES [NIST SP 800-171A]
Determine if:
[a] connections to external systems are identified;
[b] the use of external systems is identified;
[c] connections to external systems are verified;
[d] the use of external systems is verified;
[e] connections to external systems are controlled/limited; and
[f] the use of external systems is controlled/limited.
POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS [NIST SP 800-171A]
Examine
[SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing the use of external systems;
terms and conditions for external systems; system security plan; list of applications
accessible from external systems; system configuration settings and associated

external systems to access organizational systems; system or network administrators;
personnel with information security responsibilities].
Test
[SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing terms and conditions on use of external
systems].
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2]
External systems are systems or components of systems for which organizations typically
have no direct supervision and authority over the application of security requirements and
controls or the determination of the effectiveness of implemented controls on those systems.
External systems include personally owned systems, components, or devices and privately-
owned computing and communications devices resident in commercial or public facilities.
This requirement also addresses the use of external systems for the processing, storage, or
transmission of FCI, including accessing cloud services (e.g., infrastructure as a service,
platform as a service, or software as a service) from organizational systems.
CMMC Self-Assessment Guide - Level 1 Version 2.0
14
AC.L1-3.1.20 External Connections
Organizations establish terms and conditions for the use of external systems in accordance
with organizational security policies and procedures. Terms and conditions address as a
minimum, the types of applications that can be accessed on organizational systems from
external systems. If terms and conditions with the owners of external systems cannot be
established, organizations may impose restrictions on organizational personnel using those
external systems.
This requirement recognizes that there are circumstances where individuals using external
systems (e.g., contractors, coalition partners) need to access organizational systems. In those
situations, organizations need confidence that the external systems contain the necessary
controls so as not to compromise, damage, or otherwise harm organizational systems.
Verification that the required controls have been effectively implemented can be achieved
by third-party, independent assessments, attestations, or other means, depending on the
assurance or confidence level required by organizations.
Note that while "external" typically refers to outside of the organization's direct supervision
and authority, that is not always the case. Regarding the protection of FCI across an
organization, the organization may have systems that process FCI and others that do not.
And among the systems that process FCI there are likely access restrictions for FCI that apply
between systems. Therefore, from the perspective of a given system, other systems within
the organization may be considered "external" to that system.
FURTHER DISCUSSION
Control and manage connections between your company network and outside networks
Outside networks could include the public internet, one of your own company's networks
that falls outside of your CMMC Assessment Scope (e.g., an isolated lab), or a network that
does not belong to your company. Tools to accomplish include firewalls and connection
allow/deny lists. External systems not controlled by your company could be running
applications that are prohibited or blocked Control and limit access to corporate networks
from personally owned devices such as laptops, tablets, and phones. You may choose to limit
how and when your network is connected to outside systems or only allow certain
employees to connect to outside systems from network resources.
Example
You and your coworkers are working on a big proposal and will put in extra hours over the
weekend to get it done. Part of the proposal includes FCI. Because FCI should not be shared
publicly, you remind your coworkers of the policy requirement to use their company laptops,
not personal laptops or tablets, when working on the proposal over the weekend [b,f]. You
also remind everyone to work from the cloud environment that is approved for processing
and storing FCI rather than the other collaborative tools that may be used for other projects
[b,f].

AC.L1-3.1.20 - External Connections
Potential Assessment Considerations
Are all connections to external systems outside of the assessment scope identified [a]?
Are external systems (e.g., systems managed by contractors, partners, or vendors;
personal devices) that are permitted to connect to or make use of organizational systems
identified [b]?
Are methods employed to ensure that only authorized connections are being made to
external systems (e.g., requiring log-ins or certificates, access from a specific IP address,
or access via VPN) [c,e]?
Are methods employed to confirm that only authorized external systems are connecting
(e.g., if employees are receiving company email on personal cell phones, is the contractor
checking to verify that only known/expected devices are connecting) [d]?
Is the use of external systems limited, including by policy or physical control [f]?

AC.L1-3.1.22 Control Public Information
AC.L1-3.1.22 - CONTROL PUBLIC INFORMATION
Control information posted or processed on publicly accessible information systems.
ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES [NIST SP 800-171A]
Determine if:
[a] individuals authorized to post or process information on publicly accessible systems
are identified;
[b] procedures to ensure FCI is not posted or processed on publicly accessible systems are
identified;
[c] a review process is in place prior to posting of any content to publicly accessible
systems;
[d] content on publicly accessible systems is reviewed to ensure that it does not include
FCI; and
[e] mechanisms are in place to remove and address improper posting of FCI.
POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS [NIST SP 800-171A]
Examine
[SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing publicly accessible content;
system security plan; list of users authorized to post publicly accessible content on
organizational systems; training materials and/or records; records of publicly accessible
information reviews; records of response to nonpublic information on public websites;

information posted on organizational systems; personnel with information security
responsibilities].
Test
[SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing management of publicly accessible content].
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2]
In accordance with laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, or standards, the
public is not authorized access to nonpublic information (e.g., information protected under
the Privacy Act, FCI, and proprietary information). This requirement addresses systems that
are controlled by the organization and accessible to the public, typically without
identification or authentication. Individuals authorized to post FCI onto publicly accessible
CMMC Self-Assessment Guide - Level 1 Version 2.0
17
AC.L1-3.1.22 Control Public Information
systems are designated. The content of information is reviewed prior to posting onto
publicly accessible systems to ensure that nonpublic information is not included.
FURTHER DISCUSSION
Do not allow FCI to become public - always safeguard the confidentiality of FCI by
controlling the posting of FCI on company-controlled websites or public forums, and the
exposure of FCI in public presentations or on public displays. It is important to know which
users are allowed to publish information on publicly accessible systems, like your company
website, and implement a review process before posting such information. If FCI is
discovered on a publicly accessible system, procedures should be in place to remove that
information and alert the appropriate parties.
Example
Your company decides to start issuing press releases about its projects in an effort to reach
more potential customers. Your company receives FCI from the government as part of its
DoD contract Because you recognize the need to manage controlled information, including
FCI, you meet with the employees who write the releases and post information to establish
a review process [c]. It is decided that you will review press releases for FCI before posting
it on the company website [a,d]. Only certain employees will be authorized to post to the
website [a].
Potential Assessment Considerations
Does information on externally facing systems (e.g., publicly accessible) have a
documented approval chain for public release [c]?

Determine if:
[a] system users are identified;
[b] processes acting on behalf of users are identified; and
[c] devices accessing the system are identified

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2]
Common device identifiers include media access control (MAC), Internet Protocol (IP)
addresses, or device-unique token identifiers Management of individual identifiers is not
applicable to shared system accounts. Typically, individual identifiers are the user names
associated with the system accounts assigned to those individuals Organizations may
require unique identification of individuals in group accounts or for detailed accountability
of individual activity. In addition, this requirement addresses individual identifiers that are
not necessarily associated with system accounts Organizational devices requiring
identification may be defined by type, by device, or by a combination of type/device.
NIST SP 800-63-3 provides guidance on digital identities
CMMC Self-Assessment Guide - Level 1 Version 2.0
19
IA.L1-3.5.1 Identification
FURTHER DISCUSSION
Make sure to assign individual, unique identifiers (e.g., user names) to all users and
processes that access company systems. Authorized devices also should have unique
identifiers. Unique identifiers can be as simple as a short set of alphanumeric characters (e.g.,
SW001 could refer to a network switch, SW002 could refer to a different network switch).
This practice, IA.L.1-3.5.1, provides a vetted and trusted identity that supports the access
control mechanism required by AC.L1-3.1.1.
Example
You want to make sure that all employees working on a project can access important
information about it. Because this is work for the DoD and may contain FCI, you also need to
prevent employees who are not working on that project from being able to access the
information. You assign each employee is assigned a unique user ID, which they use to log
into the system [a].
Potential Assessment Considerations
Are unique identifiers issued to individual users (e.g., usernames) [a]?
Are the processes and service accounts that an authorized user initiates identified (e.g.,
scripts, automatic updates, configuration updates, vulnerability scans) [b]?
Are unique device identifiers used for devices that access the system identified [c]?

IA.L1-3.5.2 Authentication
IA.L1-3.5.2 - AUTHENTICATION
Authenticate (or verify) the identities of those users, processes, or devices, as a prerequisite
to allowing access to organizational information systems.
ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES [NIST SP 800-171A]
Determine if:
[a] the identity of each user is authenticated or verified as a prerequisite to system access;
[b] the identity of each process acting on behalf of a user is authenticated or verified as a

[SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting or implementing authenticator management

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2]
Individual authenticators include the following: passwords, key cards, cryptographic
devices, and one-time password devices. Initial authenticator content is the actual content
of the authenticator, for example, the initial password. In contrast, the requirements about
authenticator content include the minimum password length. Developers ship system
components with factory default authentication credentials to allow for initial installation
and configuration. Default authentication credentials are often well known, easily
discoverable, and present a significant security risk.
Systems support authenticator management by organization-defined settings and
restrictions for various authenticator characteristics including minimum password length,
CMMC Self-Assessment Guide - Level 1 Version 2.0
23
IA.L1-3.5.2 Authentication
validation time window for time synchronous one-time tokens, and number of allowed
rejections during the verification stage of biometric authentication. Authenticator
management includes issuing and revoking, when no longer needed, authenticators for
temporary access such as that required for remote maintenance Device authenticators
include certificates and passwords.
NIST SP 800-63-3 provides guidance on digital identities
FURTHER DISCUSSION
Before you let a person or a device have access to your system, verify that the user or device
is who or what it claims to be. This verification is called authentication The most common
way to verify identity is using a username and a hard-to-guess password.
Some devices ship with default usernames and passwords. For example, some devices ship
so that when you first log on to the device, the username is "admin" and the password is
"admin". When you have devices with this type of default username and password,
immediately change the default password to a unique password you create. Default
passwords may be well known to the public, easily found in a search, or easy to guess,
allowing an unauthorized person to access your system.
Example 1
You are in charge of purchasing. You know that some laptops come with a default username
and password. You notify IT that all default passwords should be reset prior to laptop use
[a]. You ask IT to explain the importance of resetting default passwords and convey how
easily they are discovered using internet searches during next week's cybersecurity
awareness training.
Example 2
Your company decides to use cloud services for email and other capabilities. Upon reviewing
this practice, you realize every user or device that connects to the cloud service must be
authenticated. As a result, you work with your cloud service provider to ensure that only
properly authenticated users and devices are allowed to connect to the system [a,c].
Potential Assessment Considerations
Are unique authenticators used to verify user identities (e.g., passwords) [a]?
An example of a process acting on behalf of users could be a script that logs in as a person
or service account [b]. Can the contractor show that it maintains a record of all of those
service accounts for use when reviewing log data or responding to an incident?
Are user credentials authenticated in system processes (e.g., credentials binding,
certificates, tokens) [b]?
Are device identifiers used in authentication processes (e.g., MAC address, non-
anonymous computer name, certificates) [c]?

Sanitize or destroy information system media containing Federal Contract Information
before disposal or release for reuse.
ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES [NIST SP 800-171A]
Determine if:
[a] system media containing FCI is sanitized or destroyed before disposal; and
[b] system media containing FCI is sanitized before it is released for reuse.
POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS [NIST SP 800-171A]
Examine
[SELECT FROM: System media protection policy; procedures addressing media sanitization

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2]
This requirement applies to all system media, digital and non-digital, subject to disposal or
reuse. Examples include: digital media found in workstations, network components,
scanners, copiers, printers, notebook computers, and mobile devices; and non-digital media
such as paper and microfilm. The sanitization process removes information from the media
such that the information cannot be retrieved or reconstructed Sanitization techniques,
including clearing, purging, cryptographic erase, and destruction, prevent the disclosure of
information to unauthorized individuals when such media is released for reuse or disposal.
Organizations determine the appropriate sanitization methods, recognizing that destruction
may be necessary when other methods cannot be applied to the media requiring sanitization.
CMMC Self-Assessment Guide - Level 1 Version 2.0
24
MP.L1-3.8.3 Media Disposal
Organizations use discretion on the employment of sanitization techniques and procedures
for media containing information that is in the public domain or publicly releasable or
deemed to have no adverse impact on organizations or individuals if released for reuse or
disposal. Sanitization of non-digital media includes destruction, removing FCI from
documents, or redacting selected sections or words from a document by obscuring the
redacted sections or words in a manner equivalent in effectiveness to removing the words
or sections from the document NARA policy and guidance control sanitization processes for
federal contract information NIST SP 800-88 provides guidance on media sanitization.
FURTHER DISCUSSION
"Media" refers to a broad range of items that store information, including paper documents,
disks, tapes, digital photography, USB drives, CDs, DVDs, and mobile phones. It is important
to know what information is on media so that you can handle it properly. If there is FCI, you
or someone in your company should either:
shred or destroy the device before disposal so it cannot be read; or
clean or purge the information, if you want to reuse the device.
See NIST Special Publication 800-88, Revision 1, Guidelines for Media Sanitization, for more
information
Example
As you pack for an office move, you find some old CDs in a file cabinet. You determine that
one has information about an old project your company did for the DoD. You shred the CD
rather than simply throwing it in the trash [a].

badges, identification cards, and smart cards. Organizations determine the strength of
authorization credentials needed consistent with applicable laws, directives, policies,
regulations, standards, procedures, and guidelines. This requirement applies only to areas
within facilities that have not been designated as publicly accessible
Limiting physical access to equipment may include placing equipment in locked rooms or
other secured areas and allowing access to authorized individuals only, and placing

PE.L1-3.10.1 Limit Physical Access
equipment in locations that can be monitored by organizational personnel. Computing
devices, external disk drives, networking devices, monitors, printers, copiers, scanners,
facsimile machines, and audio devices are examples of equipment.
FURTHER DISCUSSION
This addresses the company's physical space (e.g., office, testing environments, equipment
rooms), technical assets, and non-technical assets that need to be protected from
unauthorized physical access. Specific environments are limited to authorized employees,
and access is controlled with badges, electronic locks, physical key locks, etc.
Output devices, such as printers, are placed in areas where their use does not expose data to
unauthorized individuals. Lists of personnel with authorized access are developed and
maintained, and personnel are issued appropriate authorization credentials
Example
You manage a DoD project that requires special equipment used only by project team
members [b,c]. You work with the facilities manager to put locks on the doors to the areas
where the equipment is stored and used [b,c,d]. Project team members are the only
individuals issued with keys to the space. This restricts access to only those employees who
work on the DoD project and require access to that equipment.
Potential Assessment Considerations
Are lists of personnel with authorized access developed and maintained, and are
appropriate authorization credentials issued [a]?"
Has the facility/building manager designated building areas as "sensitive" and designed
physical security protections (e.g., guards, locks, cameras, card readers) to limit physical
access to the area to only authorized employees [b,c,d]?9
Are output devices such as printers placed in areas where their use does not expose data
to unauthorized individuals [c]?10

Escort visitors and monitor visitor activity.
ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES [NIST SP 800-171A]
Determine if:
[a] visitors are escorted; and
[b] visitor activity is monitored
POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS [NIST SP 800-171A]
Examine
[SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy; procedures addressing
physical access control; system security plan; physical access control logs or records;
inventory records of physical access control devices; system entry and exit points; records
of key and lock combination changes; storage locations for physical access control devices;
physical access control devices; list of security safeguards controlling access to designated
publicly accessible areas within facility; other relevant documents or records].
Interview
[SELECT FROM: Personnel with physical access control responsibilities; personnel with
information security responsibilities].
Test
[SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for physical access control; mechanisms
supporting or implementing physical access control; physical access control devices].
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2]
Individuals with permanent physical access authorization credentials are not considered
visitors. Audit logs can be used to monitor visitor activity.
FURTHER DISCUSSION
Do not allow visitors, even those people you know well, to walk around your facility without
an escort. Make sure that all non-employees wear special visitor badges and/or are escorted
by an employee at all times while on the property.
Example
Coming back from a meeting, you see the friend of a coworker walking down the hallway
near your office. You know this person well and trust them, but are not sure why they are in
the building. You stop to talk, and the person explains that they are meeting a coworker for

lunch, but cannot remember where the lunchroom is. You walk the person back to the
reception area to get a visitor badge and wait until someone can escort them to the lunch
room [a]. You report this incident, and the company decides to install a badge reader at the
main door so visitors cannot enter without an escort [a].
Potential Assessment Considerations
Are personnel required to accompany visitors to areas in a facility with physical access
to organizational systems [a]?
Are visitors clearly distinguishable from regular personnel [b]?
Is visitor activity monitored (e.g., use of cameras or guards, reviews of secure areas upon
visitor departure, review of visitor audit logs) [b]?

Maintain audit logs of physical access.
ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES [NIST SP 800-171A]
Determine if:
[a] audit logs of physical access are maintained

Interview
[SELECT FROM: Personnel with physical access control responsibilities; personnel with
information security responsibilities].
Test
[SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for physical access control; mechanisms
supporting or implementing physical access control; physical access control devices].
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2]
Organizations have flexibility in the types of audit logs employed. Audit logs can be
procedural (e.g., written log of individuals accessing the facility), automated (e.g., capturing
ID provided by a Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card), or some combination thereof.
Physical access points can include facility access points, interior access points to systems or
system components requiring supplemental access controls, or both. System components
(e.g., workstations, notebook computers) may be in areas designated as publicly accessible
with organizations safeguarding access to such devices.
FURTHER DISCUSSION
Make sure you have a record of who accesses your facility (e.g., office, plant, factory). You can
do this in writing by having employees and visitors sign in and sign out or by electronic
means such as badge readers. Whatever means you use, you need to retain the access records
for the time period that your company has defined.
CMMC Self-Assessment Guide - Level 1 Version 2.0

PE.L1-3.10.4 - Physical Access Logs
Example
You and your coworkers like to have friends and family join you for lunch at the office on
Fridays. Your small company has just signed a contract with the DoD, however, and you now
need to document who enters and leaves your facility. You work with the reception staff to
ensure that all non-employees sign in at the reception area and sign out when they leave [a].
You retain those paper sign-in sheets in a locked filing cabinet for one year. Employees
receive badges or key cards that enable tracking and logging access to company facilities.
Potential Assessment Considerations
Are logs of physical access to sensitive areas (both authorized access and visitor access)
maintained per retention requirements [a]?"
Are visitor access records retained for as long as required [a]?12

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2]
Physical access devices include keys, locks, combinations, and card readers.
FURTHER DISCUSSION
Identifying and controlling physical access devices (e.g., locks, badges, key cards) is just as
important as monitoring and limiting who is able to physically access certain equipment.
Physical access devices are only strong protection if you know who has them and what access
they allow. Physical access devices can be managed using manual or automatic processes
such a list of who is assigned what key, or updating the badge access system as personnel
change roles.

you. The project on which they were working requires access to areas that contain
equipment with FCI. You receive the keys, check your electronic records against the serial
numbers on the keys to ensure all have been returned, and mark each key returned [c].
Potential Assessment Considerations
Are lists or inventories of physical access devices maintained (e.g., keys, facility badges,
key cards) [a]?
Is access to physical access devices limited (e.g., granted to, and accessible only by,
authorized individuals) [b]?
Are physical access devices managed (e.g., revoking key card access when necessary,
changing locks as needed, maintaining access control devices and systems) [c]?

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2]
Communications can be monitored, controlled, and protected at boundary components and
by restricting or prohibiting interfaces in organizational systems. Boundary components
include gateways, routers, firewalls, guards, network-based malicious code analysis and
CMMC Self-Assessment Guide - Level 1 Version 2.0

SC.L1-3.13.1 Boundary Protection
virtualization systems, or encrypted tunnels implemented within a system security
architecture (e.g., routers protecting firewalls or application gateways residing on protected
subnetworks). Restricting or prohibiting interfaces in organizational systems includes
restricting external web communications traffic to designated web servers within managed
interfaces and prohibiting external traffic that appears to be spoofing internal addresses.
Organizations consider the shared nature of commercial telecommunications services in the
implementation of security requirements associated with the use of such services.
Commercial telecommunications services are commonly based on network components and
consolidated management systems shared by all attached commercial customers and may
also include third party-provided access lines and other service elements Such transmission
services may represent sources of increased risk despite contract security provisions.
NIST SP 800-41 provides guidance on firewalls and firewall policy. NIST SP 800-125B
provides guidance on security for virtualization technologies.
FURTHER DISCUSSION
Fences, locks, badges, and key cards help keep non-employees out of your physical facilities.
Similarly, your company's IT network or system has boundaries that must be protected.
Many companies use a web proxy and a firewall.
When an employee uses a company computer to go to a website, a web proxy makes the
request on the user's behalf, looks at the web request, and decides if it should let the
employee go to the website.
A firewall controls access from the inside and outside, protecting valuable information and
resources stored on the company's network. A firewall stops unwanted traffic on the internet
from passing through an outside "fence" to the company's networks and information
systems. Internal boundaries determine where data can flow, for instance a software
development environment may have its own boundary controlling, monitoring, and
protecting the data that can leave that boundary.
You may want to monitor, control, or protect one part of the company network from another.
This can also be accomplished with a firewall and limits the ability of attackers and
disgruntled employees from entering sensitive parts of your internal network and causing
damage.
Example
You are setting up the new network and want to keep your company's information and
resources safe. You start by sketching out a simple diagram that identifies the external
boundary of your network and any internal boundaries that are needed [a,b]. The first piece
of equipment you install is the firewall, a device to separate your internal network from the
internet. The firewall also has a feature that allows you to block access to potentially
malicious websites, and you configure that service as well [a,c,e,g]. Some of your coworkers
complain that they cannot get onto certain websites (c,e,g). You explain that the new network
blocks websites that are known for spreading malware. The firewall sends you a daily digest
of blocked activity so that you can monitor the system for attack trends [c,d].

SC.L1-3.13.1 Boundary Protection
Potential Assessment Considerations
What are the external system boundary components that make up the entry and exit
points for data flow (e.g., firewalls, gateways, cloud service boundaries), behind which all
system components that handle regulated data are contained? What are the supporting
system components necessary for the protection of regulated data [a]?
What are the internal system boundary components that make up the entry and exit
points for key internal data flow (e.g., internal firewalls, routers, any devices that can
bridge the connection between one segment of the system and another) that separate
segments of the internal network - including devices that separate internal network
segments such as development and production networks as well as a traditional DMZ at
the edge of the network [b]?
Is data flowing in and out of the external and key internal system boundaries monitored
(e.g., connections are logged and able to be reviewed, suspicious traffic generates alerts)
[c,d]?
Is data traversing the external and internal system boundaries controlled such that
connections are denied by default and only authorized connections are allowed [e,f]?
Is data flowing in and out of the external and key internal system boundaries protected
(e.g., applying encryption when required or prudent, tunneling traffic as needed) [g.h]?

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2]
Subnetworks that are physically or logically separated from internal networks are referred
to as demilitarized zones (DMZs). DMZs are typically implemented with boundary control
devices and techniques that include routers, gateways, firewalls, virtualization, or cloud-
based technologies.
NIST SP 800-41 provides guidance on firewalls and firewall policy. SP 800-125B provides
guidance on security for virtualization technologies.
FURTHER DISCUSSION
Separate the publicly accessible systems from the internal systems that need to be protected.
Do not place internal systems on the same network as the publicly accessible systems and
block access by default from DMZ networks to internal networks.
CMMC Self-Assessment Guide - Level 1 Version 2.0
37
SC.L1-3.13.5 - Public-Access System Separation
One method of accomplishing this is to create a DMZ network, which enhances security by
providing public access to a specific set of resources while preventing connections from
those resources to the rest of the IT environment. Some contractors achieve a similar result
through the use of a cloud computing environment that is separated from the rest of the
company's infrastructure.
Example
The head of recruiting at your firm wants to launch a website to post job openings and allow
the public to download an application form [a]. After some discussion, your team realizes it
needs to use a firewall to create a perimeter network to do this [b]. You host the server
separately from the company's internal network and make sure the network on which it
resides is isolated with the proper firewall rules [b].
Potential Assessment Considerations
Are any system components reachable by the public (e.g., internet-facing web servers,
VPN gateways, publicly accessible cloud services) [a]?
Are publicly accessible system components on physically or logically separated
subnetworks (e.g., isolated subnetworks using separate, dedicated VLAN segments such
as DMZs) [b]?

SILL-3.14.1 Flaw Remediation
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2]
Organizations identify systems that are affected by announced software and firmware flaws
including potential vulnerabilities resulting from those flaws and report this information to
designated personnel with information security responsibilities. Security-relevant updates
include patches, service packs, hot fixes, and anti-virus signatures. Organizations address
flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response
activities, and system error handling. Organizations can take advantage of available
resources such as the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) database or Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database in remediating flaws discovered in
organizational systems.
Organization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant software and firmware
may vary based on a variety of factors including the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of
the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw). Some types of flaw remediation may require
more testing than other types of remediation NIST SP 800-40 provides guidance on patch
management technologies.
FURTHER DISCUSSION
All software and firmware have potential flaws. Many vendors work to remedy those flaws
by releasing vulnerability information and updates to their software and firmware.
Contractors must have a process to review relevant vendor notifications and updates about
problems or weaknesses. After reviewing the information, the contractor must implement a
patch management process that allows for software and firmware flaws to be fixed without
adversely affecting the system functionality. Contractors must define the time frames within
which flaws are identified, reported, and corrected for all systems. Contractors should
consider purchasing support from their vendors to ensure timely access to updates.
Example
You know that software vendors typically release patches, service packs, hot fixes, etc. and
want to make sure your software is up to date. You develop a policy that requires checking
vendor websites for flaw notifications every week [a]. The policy further requires that those
flaws be assessed for severity and patched on end-user computers once each week and
servers once each month [c,e]. Consistent with that policy, you configure the system to check
for updates weekly or daily depending on the criticality of the software [b,e]. Your team
reviews available updates and implements the applicable ones according to the defined
schedule [f].
Potential Assessment Considerations
Is the time frame (e.g., a set number of days) within which system flaw identification
activities (e.g., vulnerability scans, configuration scans, manual review) must be
performed defined and documented [a]?
Are system flaws (e.g., vulnerabilities, misconfigurations) identified in accordance with
the specified time frame [b]?

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2]
Designated locations include system entry and exit points which may include firewalls,
remote access servers, workstations, electronic mail servers, web servers, proxy servers,
notebook computers, and mobile devices. Malicious code includes viruses, worms, Trojan
horses, and spyware. Malicious code can be encoded in various formats (e.g., UUENCODE
Unicode), contained within compressed or hidden files, or hidden in files using techniques
such as steganography. Malicious code can be inserted into systems in a variety of ways
CMMC Self-Assessment Guide - Level 1 Version 2.0
42
SILL-3.14.2 - Malicious Code Proection
including web accesses, electronic mail, electronic mail attachments, and portable storage
devices. Malicious code insertions occur through the exploitation of system vulnerabilities
Malicious code protection mechanisms include anti-virus signature definitions and
reputation-based technologies. A variety of technologies and methods exist to limit or
eliminate the effects of malicious code. Pervasive configuration management and
comprehensive software integrity controls may be effective in preventing execution of
unauthorized code. In addition to commercial off-the-shelf software, malicious code may also
be present in custom-built software This could include logic bombs, back doors, and other
types of cyber-attacks that could affect organizational missions/business functions
Traditional malicious code protection mechanisms cannot always detect such code. In these
situations, organizations rely instead on other safeguards including secure coding practices,
configuration management and control, trusted procurement processes, and monitoring
practices to help ensure that software does not perform functions other than the functions
intended NIST SP 800-83 provides guidance on malware incident prevention.
FURTHER DISCUSSION
Malicious code purposely performs unauthorized activity that undermines the security of an
information system. A designated location may be a network device such as a firewall or an
end user's computer.
Malicious code, which can be delivered by a range of means (e.g., email, removable media, or
websites), includes the following:
Virus - program designed to damage, steal information change data, send email, show
messages, or any combination of these things;
Spyware - program designed to gather information about a person's activity in secret,
usually installed without the person knowing when they click on a link;
Trojan Horse - type of malware made to look like legitimate software and used by cyber
criminals to get access to a company's systems; and
Ransomware - type of malware that threatens to publish the contractor's data or
perpetually block access to it unless a ransom is paid.
Use anti-malware tools to stop or lessen the impact of malicious code.
Example
You are buying a new computer and want to protect your company's information from
viruses and spyware. You buy and install anti-malware software [a,b].

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R
Malicious code protection mechanisms include anti-virus signature definitions and
reputation-based technologies. A variety of technologies and methods exist to limit or
eliminate the effects of malicious code. Pervasive configuration management and
comprehensive software integrity controls may be effective in preventing execution of
unauthorized code. In addition to commercial off-the-shelf software, malicious code may also
be present in custom-built software This could include logic bombs, back doors, and other
types of cyber-attacks that could affect organizational missions/business functions.
Traditional malicious code protection mechanisms cannot always detect such code. In these
situations, organizations rely instead on other safeguards including secure coding practices,

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0
February 26, 2024
Preface
The Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 is designed to help organizations of all sizes and sectors
- including industry, government, academia, and nonprofit - to manage and reduce their
cybersecurity risks. It is useful regardless of the maturity level and technical sophistication of an
organization's cybersecurity programs. Nevertheless, the CSF does not embrace a one-size-fits-
all approach. Each organization has both common and unique risks, as well as varying risk
appetites and tolerances, specific missions, and objectives to achieve those missions. By
necessity, the way organizations implement the CSF will vary.
Ideally, the CSF will be used to address cybersecurity risks alongside other risks of the
enterprise, including those that are financial, privacy, supply chain, reputational, technological,
or physical in nature.
The CSF describes desired outcomes that are intended to be understood by a broad audience,
including executives, managers, and practitioners, regardless of their cybersecurity expertise.
Because these outcomes are sector-, country-, and technology-neutral, they provide an
organization with the flexibility needed to address their unique risks, technologies, and mission
considerations Outcomes are mapped directly to a list of potential security controls for
immediate consideration to mitigate cybersecurity risks.
Although not prescriptive, the CSF assists its users in learning about and selecting specific
outcomes. Suggestions for how specific outcomes may be achieved are provided in an
expanding suite of online resources that complement the CSF, including a series of Quick Start
Guides (QSGs). Also, various tools offer downloadable formats to help organizations that
choose to automate some of their processes. The QSGs suggest initial ways to use the CSF and
invite the reader to explore the CSF and related resources in greater depth. Available through
the NIST CSF website, the CSF and these supplementary resources from NIST and others should
be viewed as a "CSF portfolio" to help manage and reduce risks. Regardless of how it is applied,
the CSF prompts its users to consider their cybersecurity posture in context and then adapt the
CSF to their specific needs.
Building on previous versions, CSF 2.0 contains new features that highlight the importance of
governance and supply chains. Special attention is paid to the QSGs to ensure that the CSF is
relevant and readily accessible by smaller organizations as well as their larger counterparts.
NIST now provides Implementation Examples and Informative References, which are available
online and updated regularly. Creating current and target state Organizational Profiles helps
organizations to compare where they are versus where they want or need to be and allows
them to implement and assess security controls more quickly.
Cybersecurity risks are expanding constantly, and managing those risks must be a continuous
process. This is true regardless of whether an organization is just beginning to confront its
cybersecurity challenges or whether it has been active for many years with a sophisticated,
well-resourced cybersecurity team. The CSF is designed to be valuable for any type of
organization and is expected to provide appropriate guidance over a long time.

SILL-3.14.4 - Update Malicious Code Protection
configuration management and control, trusted procurement processes, and monitoring
practices to help ensure that software does not perform functions other than the functions
intended.
FURTHER DISCUSSION
Malware changes on an hourly or daily basis, and it is important to update detection and
protection mechanisms frequently to maintain the effectiveness of the protection.
Example
You have installed anti-malware software to protect a computer from malicious code.
Knowing that malware evolves rapidly, you configure the software to automatically check
for malware definition updates every day and update as needed [a].
Potential Assessment Considerations
Is there a defined frequency by which malicious code protection mechanisms must be
updated (e.g., frequency of automatic updates or manual processes) [a]?

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2]
Periodic scans of organizational systems and real-time scans of files from external sources
can detect malicious code. Malicious code can be encoded in various formats (e.g.,
UUENCODE Unicode), contained within compressed or hidden files, or hidden in files using
techniques such as steganography. Malicious code can be inserted into systems in a variety

1. Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) Overview
This document is version 2.0 of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (Framework or CSF). It
includes the following components:
CSF Core, the nucleus of the CSF, which is a taxonomy of high-level cybersecurity
outcomes that can help any organization manage its cybersecurity risks. The CSF Core
components are a hierarchy of Functions, Categories, and Subcategories that detail each
outcome. These outcomes can be understood by a broad audience, including
executives, managers, and practitioners, regardless of their cybersecurity expertise.
Because the outcomes are sector-, country-, and technology-neutral, they provide an
organization with the flexibility needed to address its unique risks, technologies, and
mission considerations
CSF Organizational Profiles, which are a mechanism for describing an organization's
current and/or target cybersecurity posture in terms of the CSF Core's outcomes
CSF Tiers, which can be applied to CSF Organizational Profiles to characterize the rigor of
an organization's cybersecurity risk governance and management practices. Tiers can
also provide context for how an organization views cybersecurity risks and the processes
in place to manage those risks.
This document describes what desirable outcomes an organization can aspire to achieve.
It
does not prescribe outcomes nor how they may be achieved Descriptions of how an
organization can achieve those outcomes are provided in a suite of online resources that
complement the CSF and are available through the NIST CSF website. These resources offer
additional guidance on practices and controls that could be used to achieve outcomes and are
intended to help an organization understand adopt, and use the CSF. They include:
Informative References that point to sources of guidance on each outcome from existing
global standards, guidelines, frameworks, regulations, policies, etc.
Implementation Examples that illustrate potential ways to achieve each outcome
Quick-Start Guides that give actionable guidance on using the CSF and its online
resources, including transitioning from previous CSF versions to version 2.0
Community Profiles and Organizational Profile Templates that help an organization put
the CSF into practice and set priorities for managing cybersecurity risks
An organization can use the CSF Core, Profiles, and Tiers with the supplementary resources to
understand, assess, prioritize, and communicate cybersecurity risks.
Understand and Assess: Describe the current or target cybersecurity posture of part or
all of an organization, determine gaps, and assess progress toward addressing those
gaps.

NIST CSWP 29
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0
February 26, 2024
Prioritize: Identify, organize, and prioritize actions for managing cybersecurity risks that
align with the organization's mission, legal and regulatory requirements, and risk
management and governance expectations.
Communicate: Provide a common language for communicating inside and outside the
organization about cybersecurity risks, capabilities, needs, and expectations.
The CSF is designed to be used by organizations of all sizes and sectors, including industry,
government, academia, and nonprofit organizations, regardless of the maturity level of their
cybersecurity programs. The CSF is a foundational resource that may be adopted voluntarily
and through governmental policies and mandates. The CSF's taxonomy and referenced
standards, guidelines, and practices are not country-specific, and previous versions of the CSF
have been leveraged successfully by many governments and other organizations both inside
and outside of the United States.
The CSF should be used in conjunction with other resources (e.g., frameworks, standards,
guidelines, leading practices) to better manage cybersecurity risks and inform the overall
management of information and communications technology (ICT) risks at an enterprise level.
The CSF is a flexible framework that is intended to be tailored for use by all organizations
regardless of size. Organizations will continue to have unique risks - including different threats
and vulnerabilities - and risk tolerances, as well as unique mission objectives and
requirements. Thus, organizations approaches to managing risks and their implementations of
the CSF will vary.
The remainder of this document is structured as follows:
Section 2 explains the basics of the CSF Core: Functions, Categories, and Subcategories.
Section 3 defines the concepts of CSF Profiles and Tiers.
Section 4 provides an overview of selected components of the CSF's suite of online
resources: Informative References, Implementation Examples, and Quick Start Guides.
Section 5 discusses how an organization can integrate the CSF with other risk
management programs.
Appendix A is the CSF Core.
Appendix B contains a notional illustration of the CSF Tiers.
Appendix C is a glossary of CSF terminology.

2. Introduction to the CSF Core
Appendix A is the CSF Core - a set of cybersecurity outcomes arranged by Function, then
Category, and finally Subcategory, as depicted in Fig. 1. These outcomes are not a checklist of
actions to perform; specific actions taken to achieve an outcome will vary by organization and
use case, as will the individual responsible for those actions. Additionally, the order and size of
Functions, Categories, and Subcategories in the Core does not imply the sequence or
importance of achieving them. The structure of the Core is intended to resonate most with
those charged with operationalizing risk management within an organization.

Fig. 1. CSF Core structure
The CSF Core Functions - GOVERN, IDENTIFY, PROTECT, DETECT, RESPOND, and RECOVER - organize
cybersecurity outcomes at their highest level.
GOVERN (GV) - The organization's cybersecurity risk management strategy,
expectations, and policy are established, communicated, and monitored The GOVERN
Function provides outcomes to inform what an organization may do to achieve and
prioritize the outcomes of the other five Functions in the context of its mission and
stakeholder expectations. Governance activities are critical for incorporating
cybersecurity into an organization's broader enterprise risk management (ERM)
strategy. GOVERN addresses an understanding of organizational context; the
establishment of cybersecurity strategy and cybersecurity supply chain risk
management; roles, responsibilities, and authorities; policy; and the oversight of
cybersecurity strategy.
IDENTIFY (ID) - The organization's current cybersecurity risks are understood.
Understanding the organization's assets (e.g., data, hardware, software, systems,
facilities, services, people), suppliers, and related cybersecurity risks enables an
organization to prioritize its efforts consistent with its risk management strategy and the
mission needs identified under GOVERN. This Function also includes the identification of

improvement opportunities for the organization's policies, plans, processes, procedures,
and practices that support cybersecurity risk management to inform efforts under all six
Functions.
PROTECT (PR) - Safeguards to manage the organization's cybersecurity risks are used.
Once assets and risks are identified and prioritized, PROTECT supports the ability to
secure those assets to prevent or lower the likelihood and impact of adverse
cybersecurity events, as well as to increase the likelihood and impact of taking
advantage of opportunities. Outcomes covered by this Function include identity
management, authentication, and access control; awareness and training; data security;
platform security (i.e., securing the hardware, software, and services of physical and
virtual platforms); and the resilience of technology infrastructure
DETECT (DE) - Possible cybersecurity attacks and compromises are found and analyzed.
DETECT enables the timely discovery and analysis of anomalies, indicators of
compromise, and other potentially adverse events that may indicate that cybersecurity
attacks and incidents are occurring. This Function supports successful incident response
and recovery activities
RESPOND (RS) - Actions regarding a detected cybersecurity incident are taken, RESPOND
supports the ability to contain the effects of cybersecurity incidents. Outcomes within
this Function cover incident management, analysis, mitigation, reporting, and
communication
RECOVER (RC) - Assets and operations affected by a cybersecurity incident are restored
RECOVER supports the timely restoration of normal operations to reduce the effects of
cybersecurity incidents and enable appropriate communication during recovery efforts.
While many cybersecurity risk management activities focus on preventing negative events
from occurring, they may also support taking advantage of positive opportunities. Actions to
reduce cybersecurity risk might benefit an organization in other ways, like increasing
revenue (e.g., first offering excess facility space to a commercial hosting provider for hosting
their own and other organizations' data centers, then moving a major financial system from
the organization's in-house data center to the hosting provider to reduce cybersecurity
risks).
Figure 2 shows the CSF Functions as a wheel because all of the Functions relate to one another.
For example, an organization will categorize assets under IDENTIFY and take steps to secure
those assets under PROTECT. Investments in planning and testing in the GOVERN and IDENTIFY
Functions will support timely detection of unexpected events in the DETECT Function, as well as
enabling incident response and recovery actions for cybersecurity incidents in the RESPOND and
RECOVER Functions. GOVERN is in the center of the wheel because it informs how an organization
will implement the other five Functions.
